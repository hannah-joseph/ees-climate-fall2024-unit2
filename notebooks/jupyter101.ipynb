To do any of these commands you can select the cells and then navigate to the toolbar - the scissor icon is the Cut command, the double pages icon next to it is the Copy command, and the clipboard and page icon next to that is the Paste icon. Alternatively, you can do the same commands by going to the Menu and clicking Edit (where there are commands Cut Cells, Copy Cells, Paste Cells Above, Paste Cells Below, Paste Cells and Replace)."
